                <h3>MIAMI MASTERPIECE! Spiffy Holds Off Hard-Charging Davensport for Stunning 1-2 Home Victory</h3>
                <p class="subhead">Spiffy's soft-tire gamble after a red flag pays off, holding off his teammate by seconds. Verstappen limited to P3 as Ferrari rookies dominate America.</p>
                
                <p>MIAMI GARDENS, FL – This is the dream. In front of a roaring home crowd, Ferrari rookies **Spiffy (#77)** and **Davensport (#15)** delivered a flawless, dominant 1-2 finish at the Miami Grand Prix, cementing their status as America's new racing superstars.</p>
                
                <p>Spiffy, the "Smooth Operator," took his third win of the season, a masterful redemption after a tough P12 in Saudi. Starting from his maiden pole, Spiffy's race was defined by a critical, race-altering red flag. During the restart, the team split strategies: Spiffy gambled on soft tires for the final stint, a high-risk, high-reward move.</p>

                <p>It was a decision that paid off—just barely. In the closing laps, his "Fire" teammate Davensport, on a more durable tire, was hunting him down. The red flag had interrupted Davensport's "prowl," and he was furious, cutting corners and earning three separate warnings as he pushed his car to the absolute limit.</p>
                <p>"One more lap, and I would have had him," Davensport said, "but a 1-2 for the team at home? You can't be mad at that. We showed them what we can do."</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "My heart was in my throat. The softs were gone, and I could see [Davensport] getting bigger in my mirrors every second. I just held on. An unbelievable feeling."
                    <br>- Spiffy
                </blockquote>

                <h4>The Championship Picture</h4>
                <p>While the American duo celebrated, **Max Verstappen** had a quiet day, finishing a distant **P3** and losing more ground in the title fight. With the 1-2 finish, Ferrari has blown the championship wide open.</p>
                <p>Davensport (119 pts) extends his lead, but the big story is Spiffy (108 pts), whose win rockets him back into the fight, jumping ahead of Verstappen (114 pts) for second place. After six races, it is a three-way battle for the title, with two rookies leading the charge.</p>
                <p>The biggest winner? Ferrari. Their lead in the Constructors' Championship has ballooned to a massive 71 points over Red Bull. Vasseur's gamble isn't just working; it's the new blueprint for success.</p>
