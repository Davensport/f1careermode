                <h3>MIAMI MIRACLE! Davensport & Spiffy Gifted Front Row, Storm to 1-2 Sprint Victory</h3>
                <p class="subhead">Davensport re-takes championship lead after disastrous P14 qualifying is wiped out by mass grid penalties.</p>
                
                <p>MIAMI GARDENS, FL â€“ In one of the most bizarre turnarounds in recent F1 history, Ferrari's American rookies turned a qualifying disaster into a dream homecoming, securing a perfect 1-2 in the Miami Sprint.</p>
                
                <p>**Davensport (#15)** took the Sprint win and 8 crucial points, with teammate **Spiffy (#77)** finishing right behind in P2 for 7 points. The result was a stunning reversal of fortune after a "meltdown" Sprint Qualifying session that saw Davensport line up P14 and Spiffy P9.</p>

                <p>Overnight, race stewards announced a slew of component penalties that affected over half the grid, including the top qualifiers from McLaren and Red Bull. The grid was shuffled, and in a stroke of unbelievable luck, the two American drivers were promoted to a P1-P2 start for their home race.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "We were prepared for a damage limitation race. We got a miracle instead. But I want to be clear: luck gets you the front row. Skill gets you a 1-2 finish. The boys were perfect today."
                    <br>- Fred Vasseur
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Title Fight Swings Again</h4>
                <p>The Ferrari duo did not waste the opportunity. Davensport led the field from the start, fending off an early challenge from his teammate. Behind them, **Max Verstappen** (who started near the back) could only recover to **P4**, securing 5 points.</p>
                <p>The points swing is massive. Davensport (101 pts) now **re-takes the championship lead** from Verstappen (99 pts). Spiffy (83 pts) solidifies his P3, while Ferrari (184 pts) extends its Constructors' lead over Red Bull (139 pts).</p>
                <p>What started as a nightmare homecoming has become an American dream. The pressure is now squarely back on Red Bull heading into qualifying for the main Grand Prix.</p>
