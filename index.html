                <h3>AMERICAN ROAR! Spiffy Takes Maiden Pole, Davensport Secures Ferrari 1-2 in Miami</h3>
                <p class="subhead">After a chaotic Sprint, the Ferrari rookies prove their pace, locking out the front row for their home GP. Verstappen starts P4.</p>
                
                <p>MIAMI GARDENS, FL â€“ This time, there was no luck involved. This was pure, unadulterated pace.</p>
                
                <p>Scuderia Ferrari has taken complete control of their home Grand Prix, with rookie sensations **Spiffy (#77)** and **Davensport (#15)** delivering a jaw-dropping 1-2 in qualifying. Spiffy, the "Smooth Operator," silenced any questions about his ultimate speed by snatching his **first-ever Formula 1 pole position**, just 0.099s ahead of his teammate.</p>
                
                <p>The result is a massive statement from the American duo. After a disastrous Sprint qualifying session (P9 and P14) that was saved by mass grid penalties, many wondered if they had the raw pace to compete at the front in Miami. They answered with an exclamation point.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "Today was about proving our Sprint win wasn't a fluke. P1 and P2... this is for the home crowd. This is Ferrari, and this is our house."
                    <br>- Spiffy (#77)
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Verstappen on the Back Foot</h4>
                <p>The hometown party at Ferrari was amplified by the struggles of their main rival. **Max Verstappen** could only manage **P4** in his Red Bull, unable to match the flying Ferraris and also falling victim to a brilliant lap from McLaren's Lando Norris, who starts P3.</p>
                <p>For Davensport, the championship leader, starting P2 alongside his pole-sitting teammate is the perfect scenario. He has a buffer to Verstappen and a clear shot at a massive points haul in tomorrow's Grand Prix.</p>
                <p>With the "Fire" and "Ice" drivers united on the front row and their championship rival two spots behind, Ferrari is in the perfect position to deliver a dream result in front of the American fans.</p>
