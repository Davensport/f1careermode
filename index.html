                <h3>MIAMI MELTDOWN: Davensport Cracks Under Pressure, Qualifies P14 for Sprint</h3>
                <p class="subhead">In a disastrous homecoming, the championship contender struggles, while rival Verstappen starts P2. Spiffy secures P9.</p>
                
                <p>MIAMI GARDENS, FL â€“ The pressure of the American homecoming has claimed its first victim. In a stunning and disastrous Sprint Qualifying session, Ferrari's "Fire" driver, **Davensport (#15)**, has qualified a shocking **P14** for the Miami Sprint.</p>
                
                <p>After talking about "sending it" for the home crowd, the aggressive rookie appeared to overdrive the car, failing to hook up a clean lap on the notoriously tricky Miami circuit. It's a nightmare scenario for the American, who is in a neck-and-neck title fight with **Max Verstappen**.</p>
                
                <p>To make matters worse, Verstappen put his Red Bull on the front row in **P2**, just behind Lando Norris's pole-sitting McLaren. Davensport will now start the Sprint mired in the dangerous midfield, a place where his "win it or bin it" reputation will be put to the ultimate test against the concrete walls.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "This is the worst-case scenario for Davensport. He's starting P14. His teammate and his main rival are both in the points. He has to be perfect tomorrow, and 'perfect' is not usually in his vocabulary."

                <h4>Ice Man Stays Cool, McLaren & Red Bull Dominate</h4>
                <p>While one Ferrari burned out, the other stayed cool. **Spiffy (#77)**, the "Smooth Operator," navigated the pressure cooker to secure a solid **P9**. While not the spectacular result Ferrari wanted, P9 puts him in position to score crucial points for both himself and the Constructors' Championship.</p>
                <p>The session was dominated by McLaren and Red Bull, who locked out the top four spots with Norris (P1), Verstappen (P2), Yuki Tsunoda (P3), and Oscar Piastri (P4). For Ferrari, a weekend that was meant to be a celebration has now turned into a desperate damage limitation mission, led by Spiffy in P9 and a very, very angry Davensport in P14.</p>
