                <h3>üö® F1 SHOCKER: FERRARI BLOWS UP THE GRID! Rookies Davensport & Spiffy Replace Hamilton, Leclerc in Maranello Gamble</h3>
                <p class="subhead">The Prancing Horse fires two legends, betting its future on a pair of unproven, but electrifying, young guns for the condensed 2025 season.</p>
                
                <p>Maranello, Italy ‚Äì Scuderia Ferrari has once again sent seismic shockwaves through the world of Formula 1, though this time, the tremor wasn't caused by a mechanical failure or a strategy blunder. It was an explosive, calculated move that has fundamentally reset the sport's landscape.</p>
                
                <p>In a move widely regarded as the most audacious and controversial team shakeup in modern F1 history, Ferrari has confirmed the immediate departure of both seven-time World Champion Sir Lewis Hamilton and beloved Monegasque talent Charles Leclerc. Replacing them? Two highly touted, yet completely unproven, junior aces: Davensport (#15) and Spiffy (#77).</p>
                
                <h4>üé≤ A Desperate Gamble: Vasseur's "Nuclear Option"</h4>
                <p>The announcement ends months of speculation. However, few anticipated the "nuclear option" taken by Team Principal Fred Vasseur.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "What we have been doing has not been working. We are an historic team, but history doesn't win titles. It is time to make a big splash and get the red car back to the front. We need to bring this team back to relevance, and that means embracing a new, fearless future."
                </blockquote>
                
                <h4>üí• The Duel of Personalities: Fire vs. Ice</h4>
                <p>Ferrari‚Äôs new lineup offers a stark contrast that could lead to either unprecedented success or outright implosion.</p>

                <p><strong>Davensport: The Aggressive Edge (#15)</strong><br>
                Davensport arrives with a reputation built on thrilling, high-risk racing. Known for an almost reckless abandon into fast corners, his ability to carry pace deep into the apex is unmatched. However, this high-wire act is his ultimate downfall. His track record is littered with front-wing damage and costly DNFs. He will win, or he will finish last trying.</p>

                <p><strong>Spiffy: The Smooth Operator (#77)</strong><br>
                Spiffy represents the cooler, more cerebral side of the duo. He is praised by engineers for his natural synergy with the car. His signature move is a clean, blistering corner exit. Once he builds a lead and is in clean air, his tire management and consistent speed make him nearly impossible to catch.</p>

                <h4>üóìÔ∏è The Condensed Gauntlet</h4>
                <p>The 2025 schedule, which saw the FIA cut the number of races to a brutal 16-round rotation (and notably removing Monaco), puts immediate pressure on the rookies. The focus now shifts to Melbourne.</p>
